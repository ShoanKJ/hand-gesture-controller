🕹️ Hand Gesture Controller for Hill Climb Racing
This project lets you play Hill Climb Racing on PC using just your hand gestures!
Using your webcam, it detects left-hand finger positions and simulates keyboard key presses (left and right arrows) to accelerate or brake — no keyboard needed!

🚗 How It Works
✋ 5 fingers up → Presses the Right Arrow key (accelerate)

✊ 0 fingers up → Presses the Left Arrow key (brake/reverse)
